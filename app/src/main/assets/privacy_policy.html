<p>1. Sharing data</p>

<p>We never share your data with anyone.</p>

<p>2. Storing data</p>

<p>KiVi only stores the data it needs to function properly &mdash; for as long as you want KiVi to function.</p>

<p>Cloud Service</p>

<p>Ugran is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents from your on our servers, so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime.</p>

<p>3. Deleting data</p>

<p>Accounts</p>

<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this by emailing us at support@ugranideas.com . Deleting your account permanently removes all your pass a snap requests, media. This action must be confirmed via your registered email address and cannot be undone.</p>

<p>Messages</p>

<p>Everything you delete is deleted forever.</p>

<p>When you delete a media file, you delete it from your KiVi Gallery. This means that a copy still stays on the server as part of your partner&lsquo;s Gallery. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it&rsquo;s gone forever.</p>

<p>Account self-destruction</p>

<p>We value our disk space greatly. If you stop using KiVi and do not login for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all your pass a snap requests, media and every other piece of data stored in your KiVi account. </p>
